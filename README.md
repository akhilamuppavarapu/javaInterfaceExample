# Java Interfaces Example

![UML Diagram](https://github.com/akhilamuppavarapu/javaInterfaceExample/blob/main/classDiagram.png)

Utilizing the aboev image as a reference, do the following tasks:

1.	Write the interface called GeometricObject, which declares two abstract methods: getPerimeter() and getArea(), as specified in the class diagram.

2.	Write the implementation class Circle, with a protected variable radius, which implements the interface GeometricObject.

3.	Write a test program called TestCircle to test the methods defined in Circle.

4.	The class ResizableCircle is defined as a subclass of the class Circle, which also implements an interface called Resizable, as shown in class diagram. The interface Resizable declares an abstract method resize(), which modifies the dimension (such as radius) by the given percentage. Write the interface Resizable and the class ResizableCircle.

5.	Write a test program called TestResizableCircle to test the methods defined in ResizableCircle.
